I am Yizhou Chen, a fifth-year graduate student at department of mathematics, UCLA. I feel fortunate to be advised by Professor Joseph Teran. \
My research interests lie in computer graphics/physics-based simulations with a focus on real-time simulation techniques based on FEM/MPM. More specifically, I am collaborating with Epic Games, Inc to develop novel solvers for high fidelity muscle/cloth simulations. Check out our project [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/chaos-flesh-overview/). \
Before my PhD I did my Bachelor and master at UCLA as well. I did double major in mathematics and German.
